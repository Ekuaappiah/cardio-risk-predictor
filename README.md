# ü´Ä Cardio-Risk-Predictor: Heart Disease Prediction Model

## üìå Overview

This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals using clinical and demographic data. The primary goal is to provide a reliable tool for early identification of at-risk patients, aiding clinical decision-making.

Dataset used: **[Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data)**  
Includes features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results.

---

## üßæ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- `age`: Age of the person  
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)  
- `cp`: Chest pain type (categorical: 0‚Äì3)  
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)  
- `restecg`: Resting ECG results (categorical)  
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)  
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise  
- `slope`: Slope of peak ST segment (categorical)  
- `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy  
- `thal`: Thalassemia (categorical)  
- `target`: 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease

## üéØ Objective

To develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease and deploy it via a web interface for use in clinical decision support.

## üß† Models & Approach

## Models Implemented

The following models have been implemented and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression** (Classification)
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (Classification)
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (Classification)
4. **Random Forest Classifier** (Classification)
5. **Decision Tree Regressor** (Regression)
6. **Random Forest Regressor** (Regression)


### Model Used:
- Random Forest Classifier (primary)

### Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Train/test split (80/20)

2. **Model Training**
   - Test multiple algorithms
   - Optimize with GridSearchCV

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Learning Curve 

4. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to predict heart disease risk for new patients

## ‚úÖ Results

The Random Forest model delivered the best overall performance and is saved for future inference and deployment in clinical applications.
